# hello-world
a little step on my way to Hamburg

I'm a passionate web developer on a learning journey to being a master in web development and using the skills that i have learnt to solve real world problems 
ideas that will take you out of this world 
Most valuable traits to look for in someone: Loyalty, discipline, dedication and honesty. with these, you can mould the person into a master in anything you want 
skills can be learnt but you either have Values and ethics or you don't
